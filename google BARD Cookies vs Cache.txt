Purpose:

Cache: Stores website resources like images, scripts, and HTML files locally on your device. This speeds up loading times when you revisit the same site.
Cookie: Stores small pieces of information about your browsing activity, like login credentials, website preferences, and items in your shopping cart. This personalizes your experience and maintains continuity across sessions.
Data type:

Cache: Holds large files like images and code.
Cookie: Primarily stores text-based information.
Storage:

Cache: Stored temporarily on your device. It gets cleared automatically or manually depending on settings.
Cookie: Can be temporary (deleted when you close your browser) or persistent (stored for a set period or until manually deleted).
Flow:

Cache: Data flows one way, from website to your device. It doesn't send information back to the website.
Cookie: Data flows both ways. The website sends the cookie to your device, and your device sends it back with subsequent requests.
Use cases:

Cache:
Speeds up loading times for news websites you visit frequently.
Improves app performance by storing frequently used data locally.
Cookie:
Keeps you logged in to websites without re-entering credentials.
Saves your preferred language and location settings.
Tracks your browsing activity for targeted advertising.
Remember:

Both caches and cookies can improve your web experience, but they serve different purposes.
Caches generally prioritize speed, while cookies focus on personalization and continuity.
You can manage both in your browser settings to optimize your privacy and preferences.
I hope this clarifies the distinctions between them! Feel free to ask if you have further questions.
